Data Visualization
Assignment 4


This visualization can be run by navigating to the file that this README is in and running the command:
python3 -m http.server
Next, navigate to the URL listed on your terminal/command prompt and click on "poverty.html".

The data that I used is included in this file, which was compiled from the poverty, education, and population datasets
on the Census Bureau website, along with two random samples that I created with the python
"subsample" command. These are not necessary to run, but could be potentially useful. To use the samples, replace 'poverty.csv' in line 21 of the code with the file name of the sample you would like to try.
